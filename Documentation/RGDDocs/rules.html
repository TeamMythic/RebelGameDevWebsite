                    You are not allowed to create layer masks in Unity since we are capped to 31 layers. If you are using layer masks for anything pleease use one of the already created layer masks. You are also only allowed 10 tags per user/team. The tag needs to follow the naming convention: YourFolderName_tagName.

                    You are prohibited from changing any folder other than the main JRPG folder or your team/personal folder. The Resources folder can be touched though, only if you make a folder with the exact name as your personal/team folder.
                    If you would like to make a learning scene or utility component that is inside the RGD_Core folder please contact a officer through discord as you are not allowed to make changes to this folder without authorization. Even though
                    you are only allowed to make changes to some folders you are still free to look and learn from other folders.
