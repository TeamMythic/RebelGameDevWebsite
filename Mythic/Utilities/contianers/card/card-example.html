                    Our club frequently hosts guest speakers from the industry and 
                    participates in local game jams and hackathons. These events are 
                    great for meeting other developers and potential employers. Not only this,
                    but our faculty advisory Dr. Sahl has helped many students get a career started
                    in the gaming industry.

                    Everyone starts somewhere. With practice, you'll find that game 
                    development becomes easier and more intuitive over time. The key

                <p>
                    Today, we’re fortunate to have a variety of game engines 
                    that handle much of the technical work for us. Each engine 
                    has its strengths and is suited to different types of games. 
                    The important thing is not just what the engine can do, but 
                    what you can achieve with it.

                <p>
                    Our club is currently in the beta phase of an exciting open-source 
                    project. This project is a collaborative framework where we work 
                    together on a unified project that includes multiple games. We're 
                    using Unity as our game engine, and GitHub as our repository. Click 
                    here to read the documentation or learn how to get started with the 
                    project on your machine.
